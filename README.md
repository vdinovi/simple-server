# Simple Server
* A simple web server I'm using as a learning tool as a try to master the fundamentals of server side development. I currently have minimal aims for what it can do, but who knows how complex it will end up.
Plans for the immediate future:
 - Simplistic user database
 - Basic IRC-like chat system, perhaps DMs later.
