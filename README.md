# Simple Server
A simple web server that I'm using as a learning tool while I try to master the fundamentals of server development. I currently have minimal aims for what it can do, but who knows how complex it will end up.

Plans for the immediate future:
 - âœ” Simplistic user database
 - Basic IRC-like chat system, perhaps DMs later.
 - File transfer and management

A (usually) outdated version is being hosted (sometimes) here for no real reason.
